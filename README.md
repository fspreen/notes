# Notes #
This is a collection of my [personal notes](index.md).  They aren't very
organized or polished.  In fact, I'm not so much _publishing_ them here as I am
_backing them up_.  So really this is all knowledge that can be found
elsewhere with a little work, and only contains stuff I'm comfortable putting
somewhere in public view.  (You won't find my family's secret stew recipe,
sorry!)  But hey, feel free to take a look, you might find something useful.

I keep these notes in a Vimwiki folder.  If the links don't work 100%, that's
probably why.
